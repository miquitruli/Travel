# Travel

Welcome to your personalized Travel app. As an adventure lover, I have many different bucketlists of the places I wish to travel. In this app, you can crete as many bucketlists as you would like! These can be unique to a certain continent, or have multiple countries from different continents. As you travel to all the desired places from your bucketlist, you can check these places off! If you're feeling nostalgic you can look at all the places you have traveled to remember the good memories. Hope you enjoy this app!
